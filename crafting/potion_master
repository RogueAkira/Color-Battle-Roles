Potion Master- (6)
- During the night, the potion master can begin crafting a potion. Can only work on crafting one potion at a time.
- The poton master can craft any of the following potions:
-- KILL POTION - Used to perform 2 weak attacks.
-- PROTECTION POTION - Use this to protect someone from all attacks during the night. This grants the target strong protection, however if the target is not attacked, the protection will continue on to the next night but instead as weak protection (Doesn't expire till attacked).
-- COMBO POTION - Use this to perform 1 weak attack and give weak protection (for 1 night) to 1 person.
- Protection given by a potion is removed when given protection by another potion (doesn't stack).
- All potions require 4 phases of crafting to make.
- The potion master does not lose crafting progress on death.
- Completed potions are stored in the potion masters inventory as items for later use (cannot be put in stash). All unused potions are lost when potion master dies. 
- Potions can only be used at night phases. Using a potion counts as vising action and occurs at night end. (Using a potion is a night action and can be roleblocked)
- Respawns in 6 phases.
