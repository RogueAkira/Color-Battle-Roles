Guard-
- Can protect someone from all attacks at all times. They will die instead of the person they protect. 
- Cannot change their target after initially picking it (Unless target somehow dies before guard). Protecting is immediate. 
- The guard cannot be role-blocked. The guard is the last layer of protection, any other protection comes first in effect before this.
- Respawns in 4 phases.
