Bounty Hunter (_)
- Every Night Phase will receive a choice of three players. 
  May only choose to kill one of them.
  Every time they successfully kill a target, they will receive some bounty points.
  Wins if they have received a net profit of 2000bp (bounty points) through bounty killing.
- To clarify, bounty points (bp) is a currency that only the Bounty Hunter can receive to buy two items from their own unique shop, and is required to fulfill their own winning condition.
  Every successful kill will give them 200bp of a bounty reward.
  If they kill a King, they will instead receive 500bp of a bounty reward.
  Every attack will be a Weak Attack [until the Player purchases the item that changes from Weak to Strong Attacks].
  May purchase two different items, which will deduct from the net profit of bounty rewards [may not purchase if their net profit is below the price]:
  + May pay 300bp to buy one weak protection (that lasts until attacked).
  + May pay 750bp to change their Weak Attacks into Strong Attacks until the end of the game.
- All Attacks are End Phase.
