Cult Leader- SOLO -
- The cult leader leads their own team that wants to end all other teams in the name of peace.
- At the start of the game, they have (players/3, rounded down) curses. They can mark any person in-game for the cost of a curse. When a person with a curse dies, the person instead of dying joins the cult leader's team.
- The added person is now on the cult's team and has the same win goal as the cult leader (The cult leader is now their new leader).
- The added person will not lose their abilities and will still have access to their old team chat.
- No one can respawn after they join the cult. The old king is irrelevant after they join the new team.
- Can't respawn. Wins if the cult is the only team alive.
