Killer- SOLO -
- Kills 1 person each night. Gets 1 heart for each kill, gets 2 hearts if they kill a solo or a king.
- Has to get at least a certain number of hearts to win. Killing the same person doesn't give any hearts. Killing a person from the same team back to back gives no hearts.
- Number of hearts they need to get is Number of players/3, rounded down. Can trade in 2 hearts for 1 strong night protection any time. The killer has strong protection until they get 2 hearts for the first time.
- If the killer ever kills multiple times in a night, then both the kills happen together, which means that the team of the last killed person applies to both the kills.
- The killer will automatically die if they can not possibly earn enough hearts to win. They will also lose if there is only 1 team left alive.
- Has no cooldown. Kill happens at night end. 
- Doesn't respawn.
