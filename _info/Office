Office

Office is a good way to boost the money your team gets by talking! By default players get 10/20 coins by talking anywhere in the server, but with level of the office, the coins per message increases by 10 coins. This is very useful if you want to earn more money by talking. Note that the usual restrictions apply, like the 5 min cooldown, the 10 character minimun rule and the no repetition policy.
