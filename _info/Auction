Auction

Every day, a powerful item will be for sale in the #auction_house . This item can be purchased by any team by winning the auction. You can use `!bid` to bid for the item, and if you win, the item will be yours. These items are powerful and can change the flow of the game if used well.

(Note- This is for the Normal Auction. Use !i blind_auction for info on blind auctions)
