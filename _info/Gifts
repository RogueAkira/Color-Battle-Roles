Gifts

Talking in #battlefield chat has a small chance of awarding you a gift! The gift package will instantly give you between 300 and 500 coins. Note that each message that does not get a gift, increases the chances slightly.

Talking in #respawning chat has a small chance of summoning a gift package! Anyone active at that time can choose to send a Good Package or a Bad Package to the people down below.

If a good package is opned, both the sender and the person who opened the package recieve 25 coins. If a bad package is opned, then the sender gains 100 coins, and the person who opened it loses 100 coins.
