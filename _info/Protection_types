Protection

In this game, there are two types of protection.

Weak Protection- This type of Protection will block ONE normal kill, but NO strong kills. 

Strong Protection- This type of Protection will blocks ALL normal kills, but only ONE strong kill.

This means, 1 Weak Protection will not stop 2 attacks on you even during the same night, whereas a Strong Protection will stop all attacks.
