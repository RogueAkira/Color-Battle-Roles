Bank

Bank is a very useful building for people who want to earn money! The bank has 2 features, namely loans and deposits.

Deposits-
You can choose to deposit any amount of money in the bank. You will earn a 10% compound interest for every 12 hours that you don't take out the cash. Note that these 12 hours are exact, and not counted by phases.

Loans-
If you are in need of some money at any point duing the game, you can use the bank's loan feature to take a loan. The loan amounts have a 10% interest rate, which is taken from your forge income until your debt is repayed. You cannot take loans whose interest amount is more than your forge income can cover. You can also partially repay your debt, which will decrease your interest amount.
