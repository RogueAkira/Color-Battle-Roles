Lynching

NOTE- This is only applicabe to games where a mafia faction exists.
Every morning, there will a poll containing all players. This is the lynch poll.

People in the game have to vote on who they think is a Mafia member. If they manage to lynch a mafia member, they will immediately die. 

Any player in the game (Who is not part of the mafia) can pay a fee of 300 coins each day to gain Lynch Immunity. If you are lynched when you have a lynch immunity, then the lynch will simply fail. If you are lynched without a lynch immunity, you will simply die.

Do note that this is one of the only 2 ways the Mafia can die since the Mafia have permanent night Protection. 

The daily lynch will stop when all mafia members are dead.
