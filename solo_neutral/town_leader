Town Leader - SOLO
- As the leader of a powerful town, you have the power to kill a person every night (End Phase action), or protect someone against all attacks for a night. (You cannot protect yourself twice in a row).
- Once you have used an action on a person other than you, you can never use an action on them again in a game.
- The town leader has to choose an action on every day that they can. Failing to do so will automatically kill them.
- The town leader submits actions during the night. Protecting a person is instant, killing a person is night end. The town leader cannot change his action, if they choose to protect a person.
- You win if you survive till the end, or if you do not have a valid target to use your power on when night starts.
- Cannot respawn.
