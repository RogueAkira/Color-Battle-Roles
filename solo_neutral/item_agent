Item Agent- SOLO -
- Has the ability to contact a person anonymously with a choice. The item agent can choose a disguise to show to people if they use their power against them. (This disguise does not work for any other checks) 
- The contacted person can pay 1000c for the services of the item agent, and can then choose to kill a person or to reveal a person's role and colour, (or to ignore the agent, which is free). If the target picks the item agent, the item agent will show up as the chosen disguise.
- If the contacted person has less than 200c, they will be killed instantly before day starts.
- Doesn't have a cooldown. The contacted person is given the choice during the next day. The item agent will win if they complete 5 trades without dying. They will automatically lose if there is only 1 team alive.
- Cannot respawn.
