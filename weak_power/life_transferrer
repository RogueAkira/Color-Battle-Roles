- Has the ability to give their life to someone else. Doing so will cause all attacks targeted at the life transferrer to fail. But any attacks towards the person with the life will affect the Transferrer as well. (Including poison, and the antidote) (If the target is poisoned, you can't cure yourself, only the target can by curing themselves.)
- Action is instant. Cannot change targets after initial pick. Picks are only done during the night.Transferring life isn't a visit.
- Respawns in 4 phases.
